OnTime, a friendly pill reminder application :)

This is a [521147S](https://weboodi.oulu.fi/oodi/opintjakstied.jsp?Kieli=6&OpinKohd=27832076) project given in Spring 2019 at University of Oulu.
It consists of the work of four teammates.

OnTime is basically a pill alarm application. It warns the user to take his pills.

We aim to contribute to the elderly people's lives :)
